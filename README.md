A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
for deploying and managing the [Chrony](https://chrony-project.org) NTP server 
in your systems.

This charm simplifies the configuration and maintenance of `chrony` across a 
range of environments, enabling basic time provision and synchronization with 
NTP servers.

## Get started
In this section, we will deploy the Chrony charm, which can be used as a time source for NTP clients.  
Youâ€™ll need a workstation, e.g., a laptop, with sufficient resources to launch a virtual machine with 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 50 GB disk space.

### Set up
You can follow the tutorial [here](https://juju.is/docs/juju/set-up--tear-down-your-test-environment#heading--set-up-automatically) to set up a test environment for Juju with LXD.

### Deploy
From inside the virtual machine, deploy the Chrony charm using the `juju deploy` command.

```
juju deploy chrony --channel latest/edge
```

### Basic operations
When the Chrony charm has finished deployment and installation, it should show the message `no time source configured`.  
Now we can run the `juju config` command to configure an upstream time source for the Chrony charm. In this example, we will use Ubuntu's time server.

```
juju config chrony sources=ntp://ntp.ubuntu.com
```

Shortly after the configuration, the Chrony charm should transition into the active state and be able to provide time to other NTP clients.
