# Chrony Operator

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
for deploying and managing the [Chrony](https://chrony-project.org) NTP server
in your systems.

This charm simplifies the configuration and maintenance of Chrony across a
range of environments, enabling basic time provision and synchronization with
NTP servers.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more. 
For Chrony, this includes: 
* Time source management
* NTS (Network Time Security) and NTS certificate management
* Enhanced observability and monitoring

The Chrony charm allows for deployment on many different virtualization platforms, from [LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) to 
[OpenStack](https://ubuntu.com/openstack) to public cloud offerings.

This charm will make operating Chrony  simple and straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through Juju's clean interface.
