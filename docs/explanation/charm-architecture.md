# Charm architecture

[Chrony](https://chrony-project.org/) is a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for synchronizing system clock across systems.

The charm is a [machine charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/charm/index.html#machine). Machine charms runs the software, chrony in this case, in a [juju machine](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/machine/).
Upon deploying the charm, juju will create a base metal, virtual machine, or system container as the juju machine.
Juju will add a juju unit for the charm, which will be running the charm code to operate an instance of chrony.

  Component(chonry, "Chrony Service", "", "NTP server")
}
```

Chrony is installed in the juju machine via apt. The chrony service is managed with systemd.
As a result, if you ssh into the juju machine and run `systemctl status chrony`, you should see the status of the chrony service:

```bash
‚óè chrony.service - chrony, an NTP client/server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/chrony.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     ...
```

After the charm is configured with source, e.g. `juju config chrony sources=ntp://ntp.ubuntu.com`. The charm would become active, and juju should make the `123/udp` port available.
The `123/udp` port on the juju machine is the used by the chorny service. Running `nc -vzu <IP of juju machine> 123` should result in:

```bash
Connection to <IP of juju machine> 123 port [udp/ntp] succeeded!
```

## Metrics

The charm supports metric collection with [Canonical Observability Stack (COS)](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack).

Once setup the charm will provide a grafana dashboard on the COS instance with stats on chrony, such as NTP packets received, number of NTP connections, etc.

As a machine charm, the charm provides `cos-agent` integration which should be integrated with the [grafana agent subordinate charm](https://charmhub.io/grafana-agent). The grafana agent will integrate with a COS instance and transfer the dashboard setup and metrics from the chrony charm to the COS instance.

## Charm code overview

The `src/charm.py` is the default entry point for a charm and has the <relevant-charm-class> Python class which inherits
from CharmBase. CharmBase is the base class from which all charms are formed, defined
by [Ops](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/ops) (Python framework for developing charms).

The `__init__` method guarantees that the charm observes all events relevant to its operation and handles them.

Take, for example, when a configuration is changed by using the CLI.

1. User runs the configuration command:
```bash
juju config <relevant-charm-configuration>
```
2. A `config-changed` event is emitted.
3. In the `__init__` method is defined how to handle this event like this:
```python
self.framework.observe(self.on.config_changed, self._on_config_changed)
```
4. The method `_on_config_changed`, for its turn, will take the necessary actions such as waiting for all the relations to be ready and then configuring the containers.
