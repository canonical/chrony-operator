  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) 
  for deploying and managing the [Chrony](https://chrony-project.org) NTP server 
  in your systems.
  
  This charm simplifies the configuration and maintenance of `chrony` across a 
  range of environments, enabling basic time provision and synchronization with 
  NTP servers.

        Time sources for the Chrony server are specified as a comma-separated list of URLs.
        Currently, the Chrony charm supports using only another NTP server as the time source.
        The format for NTP source URLs is as follows: `ntp://host[:port][?options]`, where the options is the same with 
        Chrony pool configuration settings (https://chrony-project.org/doc/4.5/chrony.conf.html).
        For NTP sources that support NTS, the URL format is: `nts://host[:nts-ke-port][?options]`. 
        The options for NTS URLs are the same as those for NTP sources.
        Here are some examples of supported sources:
        `ntp://ntp.example.com`
        `ntp://ntp.example.com:1234`
        `ntp://ntp.example.com?iburst=true&maxsources=2`
        `nts://ntp.example.com`
